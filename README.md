# A Controller for the Crazyflie #

For this optional "project" you will be applying the concepts you've learned to creating a controller for the crazyflie drone through the udacidrone API.


## Control Architecture ##

The crazyflie exposes two levels of control: velocity commands and attitude commands.  As there are two possible options, the development of an offboard controller will be done in two major steps for ease of testing and demonstration:

 - [outer loop controller](#outer-loop-controller)
     + [altitude controller](#altitude-controller)
     + [lateral position controller](#lateral-position-controller)

 - [inner loop controller](#inner-loop-controller)
     + velocity controller

The first controller that will be built is the outer loop controller which will compute velocity commands that can be sent to the crazyflie and consists of an altitude controller and a lateral position controller.  See the figure below for a schematic of this controller.

![outer loop controller schematic](crazyflie_outer.png?raw=true "Outer Loop Schematic")

The second controller that will be built is the inner loop controller which computes attitude/thrust commands from the velocity commands computed by the outer loop controller.  This then feeds those attitude/thrust commands to the crazyflie.  See the figure below for a schematic of this controller.

![inner loop controller schematic](crazyflie_outer_inner.png?raw=true "Inner Loop Schematic")

For the most part these controllers are very similar to the ones from the controls project, with a few exceptions.  The altitude controller and lateral position controller will just stop at velocity commands, we won't be calculating all the way to accelerations.  The yaw controller will be exactly the same as what was seen in the controls project as we are once again controlling yaw rate with the crazyflie.  The velocity controller is new and this is where we will control velocity by commanding attitudes.

As we build the controller step by step, we will actually be leveraging the fact that the crazyflie already has a controller written for it.  This will allow us to only introduce one part of the controller at the time and let the existing controller handling the other elements for us.  For example, as we build the altitude controller, we will be leaving lateral velocity control to the crazyflie so it will maintain 0 velocity in the lateral directions unabling us to focus entirely on the altitude controller.

## Repository Structure ##

This repository contains the skeleton code (`master` branch) for developing a controller for the crazyflie and a solution version (`solution` branch) that contains a tuned implementation of the controllers.

**NOTE: as this control is done offboard the crazyflie, there may be some variation in performance from one computer to another, so you may find that the tuning on the solution may not work best for your computer.**

There are two sets of files in the repository:

 - `*_flyer.py` - these files contain implementations of the Udacidrone `Drone` class that handle managing the link and controlling the crazyflie.  When it comes to running the code, these are the files you run.

 - `*_controller.py` - these files contain the controllers themselves (and is where you will find TODOs in the `master` branch to be completed).  There is one controller file for each the outer loop and inner loop controllers.


## Outer Loop Controller ##

The outer loop controller will be built in 2 steps, first we will build the altitude controller and then we will build the lateral position controller.  Each of these can be run and tested separately to make the building and tuning processes easier.

### Altitude Controller ###

In this first step, we will be building an altitude controller to the level of commanding velocities.  Later on we will continue to develop the altitude controller to compute thrust itself, but for now we will stop at vertical velocity as the crazyflie allows us to control this directly.

Much like in the project, we will create a PID controller on the altitude to command velocity, so the resulting command should look like the first step of your altitude controller from the controls project:

```python
def altitude_controller(self, alt_cmd, alt, hdot_cmd=0.0):
    hdot_cmd += self._kp_alt * (alt_cmd - alt)  # compute desired vertical velocity from altitude error
    hdot_cmd = np.clip(hdot_cmd, -self._hdot_max, self._hdot_max)  # saturate as desired
    return hdot_cmd
```

*NOTE: for the crazyflie a simple P controller is all that will be necessary, however try adding the I and D terms and see how it changes the controller!*

And that's it!  Now to choose a gain and see what happens (see below for chosing a gain TODO: link to section below)!

*NOTE: if you leave the lateral position gain (self._kp_pos) set to 0, then only the altitude controller will run, allowing you to focus tuning the altitude controller alone.  The crazyflie may drift slowly as it is only trying to maintain 0 lateral velocity, not hold a position, but the drift should be fairly slow.*

*NOTE: when flying, if you would like to stop the flight for any reason `ctrl+c` or `cmd+c` (for mac) will trigger landing of the crazyflie.*

### Lateral Position Controller ###

Now that we have our altitude controller, let's handle the lateral position.  Once again we will be using a PID controller on the position, so it will be the first (TODO: check how many lines) line of the controller you made for the controls project:

```python
def lateral_position_control(self, pos_cmd, pos, vel_cmd=np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0])):
    vel_cmd += self._kp_pos * (pos_cmd[0:2] - pos[0:2])  # compute lateral velocity command from position error
    vel_cmd = np.clip(vel_cmd, -self._v_max, self._v_max)  # saturate as desired
    return vel_cmd

```

*NOTE: for the crazyflie a simple P controller is all that will be necessary, however try adding the I and D terms and see how it changes the controller!*

And that's it!  Now we just need to choose a starting gain and see how it works (TODO: link to section below).

### Break: An Aside on Gain Selection ###

Now that you've coded up your controller, it's time to pick some initial gains and see how it works.  For the course, we knew the exact properties of our drone in the simulator, allowing us to calculate some initial gains mathematically, but here, that's not so much the case.  So let's see if we can build some intuition and do some back of the envelope calculation to decide on some gains.

First things first, let's make sure we don't ever try and go too fast and add a limit on the allowable velocity command.  Let's keep things nice and slow and limit the velocity to 1 m/s (TODO: decide on good starting limit here).

As a recap, our controller is calculating the position error (how far we are from where we'd like to be) and multiplying that by our gain `KpPos` to generate a velocity command.  In general, when we are far away from our target position (`pos_error >> 0`), we'd like to approach it at our max velocity, so let's not worry about that case since we've added a mechanism to limit our velocity command to a max velocity.  What really starts to come in to play here is at what distance do you want to start slowing down.

For example, let's say we have a max velocity of 1 m/s and we set `KpPos = 0.5`.  That means that anything further than 2 meters from our target, we will be flying at max speed, and once we are within 2 meters we will be slowing down until we finally reach the waypoint.


For example, let's say we set `KpPos = 0.5`, let's take a look at what it means for our crazyflie's velocity profile as it approaches the waypoint:

 - at 1 meter away, we will be flying 0.5 m/s
 - at 0.5 meters away, we will be flying at 0.25 m/s

TODO: add plot with several different gain values to illustrate the velocity profile as we approach the waypoint.

Now let's say we set `KpPos = 10`, let's take a look at what it means:

 - at 1 meter away, we will be flying at 10 m/s (or max velocity)
 - at 0.5 meters away, we will be flying at 5 m/s (or max velocity)

Do you think that the crazyflie will be able to stop without overshooting if it's still flying at 5 m/s when it's 0.5 meters away from the target position?
    
 > If the crazyflie could respond immediately to commands and instantaneously change its velocity vector, then yes, this would be possible, but alas, in the real world, we have delays, it takes some time to change velocity (and attitude), which results in needing to tune our controller.  Different drones will be able to react at different rates, allowing for much more aggressive control on some drones versus others.

Do you think you could approach the target position faster than 0.25 m/s when 5 meters out?

These are the questions that you should be asking yourself as you choose an initial set of gains to work with for your controller.  You always want to err on the side of caution and go with the option that gives you room to increase your gain to get better performance rather than have to decrease your gain.


So to build some of our intuition, we can see that setting the max speed value allows us to have very aggressive control without the proportional speed increase when `pos_error >> 0`.

## Inner Loop Controller ##

Now that we have made a working outer loop controller that is successfully able to fly the crazyflie using velocity commands, let's build an inner loop controller that will take those velocity commands and generate attitude/thrust commands to control the crazyflie.

While the entire inner loop will be tested at once, we will build it in two steps:

 1. compute attitude commands from the horizontal velocity command

 2. compute the thrust command (total thrust) from the vertical velocity command

### Attitude ###

Now that you've written a controller commanding velocity, let's go one step further and command attitude.  You may be thinking "why would I want to command attitude, when commanding a velocity gives me a good enough position controller!"  And you would be right in thinking that!  If your goal is solely to command a position in space and you have a drone that can do accurate velocity commands, then you may find you don't need to go this far.  But, what if you want to be able to not just go from point A to point B, but do so with specific orientations in space?  For example, what if you wanted to go through a window and you knew you needed to be perfectly level going through the window, or more interestingly, at a specific angle?  This starts to go into the realm of flying specific trajectories, which we will get to a little later, but provides a little insight as to why you might end up commanding at this level if you do have velocity commands at your disposal.  (Remember there is always the case where your drone only supports attitude commands!)

We have already generated a velocity command for our position error, so let's build on that and use the cascaded structure we saw in the controls projects to generate an attitude command from our velocity command:

```python
def velocity_controller(self, vel_cmd, vel):

    pitch = -self._kp_vel * (vel_cmd[0] - vel[0])  # note the sign change!  Remember + pitch is up, meaning it will send out drone backwards!
    roll = self._kp_vel * (vel_cmd[1] - vel[0])

    # add some limits
    pitch_cmd = np.clip(pitch, -self._bank_max, self._bank_max)
    roll_cmd = np.clip(roll, -self._bank_max, self._bank_max)

    ...
```

### Thrust ###

Now that we've moved on to sending attitude commands, we also need to update our altitude controller to send thrust commands instead of velocity commands.  In the controls project, the altitude controller computed all the way to thrust, but for the crazyflie, we will have this level of control done in our velocity controller.

Instead of true thrust, we will need to send a normalized thrust command, that is, a value between 0 and 1 to represent the thrust level, with 0 being no thrust and 1 being the max amount of thrust possible.  This does mean we need to know how much thrust, in [N], is the max possible thrust of the crazyflie.  We've done that calculation for you and you can find it as a constant at the top of the `TODO: file name` file.

So let's again use the same process as the controls project to compute the thrust:

```python
def velocity_controller(self, vel_cmd, vel)
    ...

    accel_cmd = self._kp_hdot * (hdot_cmd - hdot)  # compute acceleration from vertical velocity error
    accel_cmd = np.clip(accel_cmd, -self._haccel_max, self._haccel_max)  # saturate as desired
    thrust_cmd_N = DRONE_M * (accel_cmd + GRAVITY_MAG) / (np.cos(pitch_cmd) * np.cos(roll_cmd))  # compute thrust in N positive up

    # need to normalize the thrust
    thrust_cmd = thrust_cmd_N / MAX_THRUST_N

    return pitch_cmd, roll_cmd, thrust_cmd
```


### Choosing an Initial Gain ###

We are commanding attitude in radians so this is a little harder intuitively, but let's for a moment pretend we are working with degrees (and then we will adjust for the fact that we did our back of the envelope calculation in degrees).

Once again, let's look at what the attitude command profile looks like as our velocity error changes:


Again we can see that maybe starting with a smaller value (around XXX) may be a safer bet than starting with too large of a value.

**It is worth mentioning that in both of these cases there really wasn't such a thing as too small of a value, worse case your crazyflie was just not going anywhere but it still stayed airborne.  When it comes to lower level control loops, for example an attitude controller that is responsible for keeping your drone level, you will start seeing cases where you can have a gain that is too low and results in your drone falling out of the sky!**

## Flying Trajectories ##

Now that we have a controller and it is flying simply waypoint missions, let's look at extending it to flying trajectories.

For this, we have provided a framework for reading in a trajectory file (see below for the file format) and a sample figure 8 trajectory.

See how well your controller flies through the trajectory!  You may find that you might need some additional tuning or changing of your velocity limits in order to fly the trajectory the best.


### Trajectory File Format ###

A trajectory file, as currently defined by the handler class, is a text file with each line being a trajectory point.  Each line contains the following 4 pieces of information as comma separated values:

 - relative time (in flight time in [s])
 - north position (in [m])
 - east position (in [m])
 - down position (in [m])


### Further Challenges ###

We've provided you with one simple trajectory that you can feel free to try out, but now it is up to you to explore the limits that you can take your crazyflie!

For those of you who are ambitious, here are some ideas of how you might be able to extend the code provided:

 - **Create your own trajectory files.**  How quickly can you get your crazyflie to fly a given trajectory?  How tight of turns, or how complex of trajectories can your controller handle?

 - **Add attitude information to trajectory.**  Extend the trajectory handler and the file format to include attitude to each trajectory point.  Can you successfully achieve specific attitudes at specific times during the flight?



## Single Controller Option ##

In the previous two parts, we built our controller as an outer loop computing velocity commands from position information and an inner loop computing attitude/thrust commands from velocity information.  This was the same approach that was used in the controls project.

Here we will just introduce the idea of a different structure to the controller.  We have not provided example code for this structure, this is food for thought for those of you who want to explore other control structures and see how they might behave differently on a real platform.

Instead of building it as two parts, it is possible to build the entire controller as one piece:

```python
attitude_cmd = KpPos * (pos_cmd - pos) + KpVel * (vel_cmd - vel)
```

If we are not flying a trajectory, we set `vel_cmd = 0`, which means that we are constatly damping our control based on how fast we are currently traveling.  This structure ends up being a little more like a PD controller on position, but we are still directly measuring velocity instead of differentiating position.  Note that with this structure, we can't directly limit the velocity command that is created, we can only limit the attitude command.

For this one, we won't be walking through what the solution looks like directly, but rather leaving it up to you to play around with the controller and see what happens!

For those who are very ambitious, can you think of different control structures you could use?  The crazyflie can be quite forgiving, so give it a try and see how it works out!
