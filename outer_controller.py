"""Controller that generates velocity commands

Class for the specific impelementation of a controller that will be comanding velocity commands.
Contains the solution for P controllers on altitude and lateral position to commands velocities
to a crazyflie over the wireless link.


TODO: add some description / comments on how this file can be edited???
Not sure where the best place to do that is....
